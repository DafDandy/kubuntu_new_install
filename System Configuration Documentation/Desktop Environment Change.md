# Swapping Desktops to KDE

Gnome desktop, the default in fedora, isnt anything like windows so its harder to like. Gnome has no traditional desktop icons and all of your applications act closer to what you would see on an android device

If you want the traditional desktop that has the windows style application menu like this:

Run the following command in terminal:

    sudo apt install aptitude
    aptitude install kde-standard


You just need to swap the desktop on the login screen

After you have done this once you shouldnt need to do this again, it will remember your settings and log you into this desktop
